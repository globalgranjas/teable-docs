Error responses will return a JSON-encoded body containing error and information fields. Here's an example of an error response body:

```json

  "message": "not allowed to operate space|read on spcxxxxxx",
  "status": 403,
  "code": "restricted_resource"
}
```

The request has been successfully completed.

### 201 Created

The request has been successfully completed and a new resource has been created.

## Error Codes

### 401 Unauthorized

### 403 Forbidden

### 404 Not Found

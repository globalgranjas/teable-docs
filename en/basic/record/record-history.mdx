Teable's record history allows you to track and manage changes made to data over time, making it convenient to search and trace historical data.

### Permission Notes

* When permission matrix is not enabled, users with table editing permissions can view the history.

* When permission matrix is enabled, only users with administrator permissions can view the history.

## Individual Record History

This feature focuses on the detailed history of a single record. Users can select a specific record to view its complete change history.

### Access

Click the record history icon in the top-right corner of the expanded record card

### Permission Notes

* In all cases, users only need edit permission for a specific record to view its history.

## Important Notes

The smallest unit in record history is a record's cell. Therefore, when performing bulk data operations, a large amount of historical data will be generated.

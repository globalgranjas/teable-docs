### Notifications

You can change the notification mode by clicking the bell icon in the top-right corner of the comment panel.

By default, to minimize unnecessary notifications, we only send notifications when:

1. Your comment receives a reply.

2. You are @mentioned.

If you want to closely follow updates on a record, click subscribe to receive notifications whenever someone comments.

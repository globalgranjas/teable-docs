In the base invitation interface, you can see all users who have permission to access the current base, including space collaborators, who will have "Space" indicated next to their names.

### Permission Types

Base collaborator permissions are divided into:

* Creator: Can perform creation actions, modify table structure, edit automations, enable permission matrix.
* Editor: Can modify data.
* Commenter: Can comment on records but cannot modify data.
* Viewer: Can view but cannot comment.

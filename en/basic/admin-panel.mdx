### Settings

In the settings interface, you can configure general settings, including:

* Allow New User Registration: Disabling this option prevents new user registration, and the registration button will no longer appear on the login page.

* Allow Space Invitations: Disabling this option prevents users other than administrators from inviting others to join spaces. When enabled, users who are directly invited can create accounts even if new account registration is disabled.

* Allow Everyone to Create New Spaces: Disabling this option prevents users other than administrators from creating new spaces.

As well as the current instance ID and application version

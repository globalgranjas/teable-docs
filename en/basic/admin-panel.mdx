### Accessing the Admin Panel

Administrators can access the admin panel by clicking the Admin Panel button in the upper left corner after entering the application.

### Settings

In the settings interface, you can configure general settings, including:

* Allow New User Registration: Disabling this option prevents new user registration, and the registration button will no longer appear on the login page.

* Allow Space Invitations: Disabling this option prevents users other than administrators from inviting others to join spaces. When enabled, users who are directly invited can create accounts even if new account registration is disabled.

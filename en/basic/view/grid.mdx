### Creating a Grid View

As mentioned at the beginning, every table must have at least one grid view by default. Therefore, the system automatically creates a grid view whenever you add a new table. To create a new grid view in an existing table, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your space, select the base, then select the table where you want to add a new grid view.

2. Click the "Views" option near the top left of the screen. This will open the view sidebar. In some tables, the view sidebar may already be open, in which case you can proceed to the next step.

3. Find and click the "Grid+" option under the "Create..." section.

4. This opens a popup where you can name your new grid view and set view editing permissions (collaborative, personal, or locked).

5. After configuring these settings, click "Create New View."

6. At this point, you can further configure the view by hiding fields, filtering records, grouping records, sorting records, and more.

### Adjusting Row Height in Grid View

By default, grid view displays records with a short row height to maximize record density. In the short row height setting, each record shows one line of text and small attachment thumbnails. If you want to see more text and larger images, you can adjust the row height from the default short setting.

There are four different row height options:

* Short (most compact option, also the default height for new views)

* Medium

* Tall

* Extra Tall (most spacious option)

To change the row height in the current view, click the row height toggle in the view bar and select your desired height.

Shorter row heights allow you to see more records at once, while larger row heights let you see more information for each record. Specifically, larger row heights will show multiple lines of text in text fields, multiple lines in linked records, multiple select options, collaborator fields, and display larger images.

Changing row height does not affect field header height, which cannot be adjusted.

If you want to ensure your preferred row height configuration isn't accidentally changed, you can lock the view (coming soon), which will prevent all collaborators from changing the view's configuration until someone with creator permissions unlocks it.

### Hiding Fields in Grid View

To hide fields in grid view (or show hidden fields), click the "Hide Fields" button in the view bar to open the hide fields dialog. If there are no hidden fields in the current view, the "Hide Fields" button will appear as an eye icon with a line through it and display "Hide Fields."

If there are hidden fields in the current view, the "Hide Fields" button will have a blue background and (if the window is wide enough) show the specific number of hidden fields, such as "12 Hidden Fields."

When the hide fields dialog is open, you can see which fields are showing (toggle switch is green and moved to the right) and which fields are hidden (toggle switch is gray and moved to the left).

Click the toggle switch next to a field name to show or hide that field.

The "Hide All" and "Show All" buttons allow you to quickly hide/show all fields (except the primary field, which cannot be hidden).

If you have many fields, you can type search terms in the "Find Fields" search box to more easily find the field you're looking for.

Another way to hide a field is to click on the field header and select "Hide Field" from the dropdown menu.

You can also hide or show individual fields in grid view by opening the expanded record.

### Reordering Fields in Grid View

You can quickly rearrange the order of fields in your view by clicking and dragging the drag handle on field names.

You can also move fields directly by clicking and dragging field headers in the grid view.

Fields cannot be reordered in expanded records.

### Wrapping Text in Individual Cells

By default, new grid views display rows with a fixed single-line height. However, by expanding the row height, fields containing text will wrap to the next line.

Shorter row heights allow you to see more records at once, while larger row heights let you see more information for each record. Specifically, larger row heights will show multiple lines of text in text fields, multiple lines in linked records, multiple select options, collaborator fields, and display larger images.

To expand a single row at a time, you can press the spacebar when any cell in the selected row is focused.

You can also view the full content of the current cell by clicking on it, then use arrow keys to quickly move between different cells.

description: "In specific views, you can sort records based on values in particular fields to display them in a specific order. Sorting records in one view does not affect the order of records in other views—sorting only applies to the view you are currently viewing."

### Configure New Sort

To configure a new sort, follow these steps:

1. Click the "Sort" option in the view toolbar.
2. Then, select a field to sort from the field list.
3. To easily find the field you want to sort by, you can also type in the search bar.
4. Depending on the type of field you're sorting, there will be an additional option to choose the sort order. For example, in text-based fields, you can choose to sort alphabetically or reverse alphabetically, and in date fields, you can sort from earliest to latest or latest to earliest. We'll cover this in more detail in the "Field Types and Sorting" section below.
5. After selecting your first sort field, you can add more fields to sort by. Simply click the "Add another sort" option.

Once configured, you can:

* Remove any sorts you've applied by clicking the X button next to the specific field you've chosen.

* Reorder using the drag handles. We'll discuss reordering more in the next section, but remember that the sort order is hierarchical and will depend on the order of the fields chosen.

#### Reordering Sort Order:

1. Click the "Sort" option in the view toolbar.
2. Locate the 6-dot icon next to the field you want to move.
3. A hand icon should appear when you hover over the icon.
4. Click, drag, and drop the field to where you want it in the sort order.

Different field types can be sorted in different ways. Note that in almost all cases, empty values are placed first when sorting in ascending order.

* Text field types, such as single-line text fields, long text fields, or formula fields that return text, can be sorted alphabetically (A → Z) or reverse alphabetically (Z → A). Teable uses natural sort order for text, so multi-digit numbers in text fields are sorted as single characters. For example, this means "z2" would sort before "z11" because 2 is considered less than 11. Attachment fields can also be sorted alphabetically or reverse alphabetically by filename.
* Number field types, such as numbers and duration, can be sorted in ascending numerical order (1 → 9) or descending numerical order (9 → 1). Rating fields can also be sorted in ascending or descending numerical order.
* Date and time fields can be sorted using ascending (1 → 9), from earliest date to latest date, or descending (9 → 1), from latest date to earliest date.
* Checkbox fields can be sorted by whether or not the box is checked, so either (▢ → ✓) or the reverse (✓ → ▢).
* Single select and multiple select fields sort based on the order of options in the field customization menu, either (First → Last) or (Last → First). If you're sorting on a single select or multiple select field, you can change the order in which records are sorted by going into that field's customization menu (and sorting the options alphabetically if you wish).

### Automatic and Manual View Sorting

By default, when you create a new view, it will have the "Auto-sort records" toggle enabled.

If this toggle is on, records will automatically sort if changes to records would result in them being sorted differently. You will not be able to manually reorder records using the record drag handles. In grid view, if the "Auto-sort records" toggle is on, all fields that have sorts applied (as well as the sort menu button) will have a light orange background to clearly indicate that field is being auto-sorted.

If this toggle is off, records will only sort themselves when sorts are reapplied, and you can use the record drag handles to manually reorder records as you prefer. Turning off the "Auto-sort records" toggle will cause a sort button to appear in the sort menu. After manually reordering records in your view, you can always reapply sorts by manually clicking this sort option.

### Sorting Behavior from View Share Links

If you create a view share link to provide non-collaborator access to a view, the sorting criteria applied to the view will be preserved in the shared view. However, viewers will have the option to change any sort criteria (along with other view configuration options) - this only affects how they view records through the view share link and does not adjust any view configuration options in your table.

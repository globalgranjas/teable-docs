description: "The grouping functionality in Teable allows creators to establish one or more sets of conditions that help categorize data sets presented within specific views."

* Single Select fields - Status, Category, Project, etc.

* User fields
* Linked Record fields
* Multiple Select fields - For grouping records with multiple overlapping choices to create matching groups
* Date/Date Range

Multiple conditions create deeper categorization through the addition of collapsible subgroups, adding subgroups within each group of records. When combined with other options like record filtering or sorting, this allows for particularly specific organization and insights into the records contained within your dataset.

### Creating Groups in a View

To group records, open a view and click the "Group" button located between the filter and sort buttons. Choose from suggested fields or click "View all fields" to select from all available fields.

#### Adding One or More Record Subgroups

Once you select the field you want to group by, groups are automatically created based on unique values in that field. New groups are also automatically added whenever new unique values are entered in the specified field. You can also group records by multiple fields by clicking the "Add subgroup" option.

#### Additional Group Configuration Options

Now that you have set up one or more groups, here are some additional options to consider:

* Collapse or expand all groups in the view
* Change the field referenced in a group or subgroup by selecting from the dropdown options
* Change the sort order of a group or subgroup by selecting from the dropdown options
* Choose whether to show or hide empty groups
* Remove specific groups or subgroups
* Drag subgroups to move their grouping order

#### Drag Records to Reassign Values

You can change the values of records within groups by clicking the drag handle to the left of a record and dragging it to a different group. For example, you can drag a task assigned to one person into another person's group, and that task will automatically be reassigned to the new person.

Note that you cannot add new records to groups based on calculated field types (such as lookup, rollup, or formula fields).

#### Grouped Records and Summary Bar (Coming Soon)

Each group has a summary bar at the top that can summarize cell values in numeric fields by each group. These summary bars let you see subtotals for each group. Each group will also have a count of the number of records.

Like the summary bar for the entire table, each group's summary bar can provide different summary functions.

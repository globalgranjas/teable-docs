title: "Filter"
description: "Filtering is a key tool for data management, allowing users to quickly find desired data sets based on specific conditions. This document provides a detailed introduction to the filtering functionality, including explanations of operators, field types, condition grouping, and other aspects to help users fully understand and utilize filtering for data analysis and management."

### Basic Rules List

#### Adding Conditions

* Users can set filter rules by clicking the "Add condition" button.
* Each condition consists of three parts: field, operator, and value.
* Supports direct value input or selection from preset options.

#### Adding Condition Groups

* Through the "Add group" button, users can "create condition groups" using "AND" or "OR" logic to connect conditions.
* Groups can be nested with more groups inside to implement complex filtering logic.

#### Supported Basic Types and Operators

**Text Type**

Equals, Does not equal, Contains, Does not contain, Is empty, Is not empty

**Number Type**

=, ≠, >, ≥, \<, ≤, Is empty, Is not empty

**Date Type**

Before, After, Between, Equals, Does not equal, Is empty, Is not empty

**Boolean Field**

Is, Is not

**Custom Option Field**

Equals, Does not equal

#### Operators and Their Input Data Types

* Text operators accept string type data.
* Number operators accept numerical type data.
* Date operators accept date type data.
* Boolean operators require no input, direct selection.
* Custom option operators accept predefined options.

### Field Types and Operator Mapping

| User | Equals, Does not equal, Contains any, Does not contain any, Is empty, Is not empty | User selection list, and current user |
| Attachment | Is empty, Is not empty | - |
| Multiple Select | Contains any, Contains all, Exactly matches, Does not contain any, Is empty, Is not empty | Option selection list |
| Single Select | Equals, Does not equal, Contains any, Does not contain any | Option selection list |
| Date | Equals, Does not equal, Within, Before, After, On or before, On or after, Is empty, Is not empty | Preset range list, precise date picker |

| Duration | Equals, Does not equal, Greater than, Greater than or equal to, Less than, Less than or equal to, Is empty, Is not empty | Number |
| Rating | Equals, Does not equal, Greater than, Greater than or equal to, Less than, Less than or equal to, Is empty, Is not empty | Number |
| Formula | Operators determined by result type | Text, Number, Date |
| Rollup | Operators determined by result type | Text, Number, Date |
| Count | Equals, Does not equal, Greater than, Greater than or equal to, Less than, Less than or equal to, Is empty, Is not empty | Number |
| Lookup | Equals, Does not equal, Contains, Does not contain, Contains any, Contains all, Exactly matches, Does not contain any, Is empty, Is not empty | Lookup value selector |
| Created Time | Equals, Does not equal, Within, Before, After, On or before, On or after, Is empty, Is not empty | Preset range list, precise date picker |
| Last Modified Time | Equals, Does not equal, Within, Before, After, On or before, On or after, Is empty, Is not empty | Preset range list, precise date picker |
| Created By | Equals, Does not equal | User selection list, and current user |
| Last Modified By | Equals, Does not equal | User selection list, and current user |
| Auto Number | =, ≠, >, ≥, \<, ≤ | Number |
| Button | - | - |


**Formula and Rollup field operators are determined by their result type, which may include all operators mentioned above.**

### Condition Grouping Functionality

Condition grouping allows users to combine multiple conditions using logical operators (such as "AND/OR"). The core of this functionality lies in its logical flexibility and combinatorial capabilities, enabling users to construct nested logic based on complex requirements for refined data filtering.

#### AND/OR Logic

* **AND Logic**: All conditions within the group must be satisfied simultaneously to select data.
* **OR Logic**: Any condition within the group being satisfied is sufficient to select data.

#### Combination Operations

* Users can create multi-level nested condition groups, with each level defining its own logical relationship.
* Groups can be infinitely nested to achieve extremely complex filtering logic.

#### Steps for Using Condition Groups

1. **Create Group**: Users create a new condition group through the interface command.
2. **Add Conditions**: Within the group, users can add multiple filter conditions.
3. **Select Logic**: For conditions within the group, users need to choose "AND" or "OR" logic.
4. **Nest Groups**: Users can continue to create new subgroups inside a group and set conditions and logic for them.
5. **Optimize Logic**: Users can adjust the logical relationships of various conditions and groups as needed to achieve the desired filtering effect.

#### Example

Suppose a user needs to filter a database to find all records that were "created by a specific user" AND "either modified in the past week OR have a rating above 8", they can construct the following condition group logic:

* Main Group (AND)
  * Condition 1: Created By = Specific User (AND)
  * Subgroup (OR)
    * Condition 2: Last Modified Time = Past Week
    * Condition 3: Rating > 8

Through such group and condition settings, the filtering functionality can precisely output data records that meet all the above conditions.

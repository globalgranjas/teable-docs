### Overview

Forms are perfect for various purposes like recording expenses, collecting feedback, creating polls and quizzes, gathering customer information, and more. Teable forms support file attachments, work well on mobile devices, and connect to the Teable API. Unlike other products that require building forms from scratch, Teable's form views are automatically generated from your existing tables, then allow you to rearrange and remove fields.

#### Step 1: Add a New Form View

To create a new form view, navigate to the table where you'll collect new data. Open the view sidebar and click the form option under the create heading. If your view creation section is collapsed, you'll need to expand it first.

#### Step 2: Initial View Settings

You'll have the opportunity to give your form view a unique title and set the view as collaborative or personal. Note that you can lock the form view only after completing the initial form view settings. After setting the title and view permissions, click create new view.

#### Step 3: Add, Hide, and Reorder Fields

This opens the form builder where you can further customize your form before sharing it with others. Advanced plans offer the ability to add cover images or logos to forms. You can add a description to your form by clicking the header area and adding a description.

Fields on the form are automatically populated based on all fields shown in the grid view where they first appear in the table.

To change the order of fields on your form, click a field and use its drag handle to move it. To hide a field from the form, you can click the hide button in the top right corner of the field you wish to hide, or drag and drop the field to the left side of the form builder. To add a field to the form, drag it from the left side onto the form. If you realize you want to add a field to your form that doesn't yet exist in your table, you can click the + Add field to this table button in the fields sidebar. Sometimes you may need to return to the form later to add or remove fields. Simply return to the form's view and adjust the settings. You can also customize field settings by clicking the field, clicking the dropdown arrow next to the field name, and selecting customize field type from the dropdown menu. This opens the same field customization menu you see when customizing fields in grid view.

#### Step 4: Customize Form Fields

Beyond customizing which fields will appear on your form and their order, you can adjust how fields display to end users. Clicking any field in the form builder will pop up numerous display options. For all field types, you can change the name that displays on the form and add a subtitle to provide helpful context. Some field types offer additional display setting options, which are covered in the sections below.

You can also toggle the required option to make filling out a field necessary before submitting the form. Note that if you make a checkbox field required, the checkbox must be checked to submit the form.

#### Step 5: Share Form URL

Once you've finished building your form, you can click the share form button in the view bar. This will give you a link you can copy and paste. Clicking the preview button will also take you directly to the form share link in your browser. The sections below will cover more form sharing options.

### Additional Form Configuration Options

#### Adding a Cover Image

To add a cover image, click add cover image in the gray area and upload your desired image. You can also crop or rotate the image in the file picker. Note that the form cover image area is always 240px tall and the width of your browser window. It's best to use cover images as background graphics that add an interesting feel to your form rather than for important information that might get cropped.

#### Adding Password Protection

When sharing a form, you can choose to set a password. In this case, the form can only be submitted after entering the correct password.

#### Track Form Submitters

Enabling this feature will automatically collect form submitter information so form responses can be traced to specific individuals. A few notes about expected behavior:

* Form submitters will be asked to log into Teable (if they aren't already logged in on their browser) or create a Teable user account so their name and email address can be collected with their form submission.

* The responder's information will appear in the "Created By" field in the table where the form was created.

### Customizing Form Fields

#### Adding Conditional Logic to Form Fields

Sometimes you may want to restrict which form fields appear based on certain conditions. Some examples include:

* Hiding certain fields unless another field option is selected.

* Showing fields to help submitters provide more in-depth information.

* Displaying fields related to specific teams or individuals based on previous form field entries. The conditional logic functionality in form view settings works the same way as it does elsewhere in Teable.

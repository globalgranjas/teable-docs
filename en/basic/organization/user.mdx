## User List

The user list displays basic information for all members in the organization:
- User avatar and name
- User type (External/Internal user)
- Email address
- Join date
- User status (Active/Deactivated)

## Adding Users

1. Click the "Add User to Organization" button in the top left
2. Enter the new user's email address in the popup dialog
3. Click the "Add" button to complete the operation

After adding, the system will send an invitation link to the email address. Users need to accept the invitation through the link in the email to join the organization.

## User Management Operations

In the user list, the "..." menu at the end of each user row provides the following operations:
- Activate: Re-enable a deactivated user account
- Set as Administrator: Promote a regular user to organization administrator
- Delete: Remove the user from the organization

## Searching Users

Use the search box in the top right corner to quickly find specific users by name or email address.

## Email Domain Verification Settings

Email domain verification allows organization administrators to verify their organization's email domains. When new users register using an email address with a verified domain, the system automatically adds them to the corresponding organization.

### Domain Verification Process

### 1. Add New Domain
1. Click the "Add Domain" button on the security settings page
2. Enter the domain to be verified in the popup dialog

### 2. Verify Domain Ownership
1. The system will send a verification code to the admin email address of the domain
2. Enter the received verification code in the verification code input field
3. Click the "Verify" button to complete domain verification

### 3. Domain Management
- Verified domains will be displayed in the domain list
- The list shows domain names and creation dates
- Administrators can view and manage all verified domains

## Important Notes
1. Ensure you have access to the domain administrator email
2. Verification codes have a limited validity period, complete verification promptly
3. Each organization can verify multiple domains
4. After successful verification, new users registering with email addresses from the verified domain will automatically join the organization

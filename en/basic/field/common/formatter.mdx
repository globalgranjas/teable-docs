> Rating fields are displayed as interactive rating bars represented by a series of icons that can be illuminated. While they can't participate in number formatting, they are inherently numeric and can be used in numerical calculations.
> Formula and Rollup field formatting depends on their output type. This means if a formula or rollup results in a date or number type, it can be formatted. If the result is text or boolean, formatting is not applicable.
> All fields can be referenced, and when referenced, they maintain their basic value type.

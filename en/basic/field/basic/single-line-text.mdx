When inputting, you can directly type text after clicking a cell with your mouse, or use common text editing operations like cut, copy, and paste.

The input text content can be used for filtering and sorting, and supports text processing functions for operations like extraction. Users can also conveniently set default values for text fields to reduce repetitive input.

### Interactive Display

Text fields support four common interactive display modes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Default">
    This is the default display format and most commonly used. The displayed text has no additional features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="URL">
    Text displayed as a URL will launch the user's default browser and automatically visit that web address when clicked.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Email">
    Text displayed as an Email will launch the user's default email application (such as Outlook, Mail, etc.) when clicked.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Phone">
    Text displayed as a phone number will launch the user's default communication application (such as Facetime, Skype, etc.) when clicked.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Setting Display Mode

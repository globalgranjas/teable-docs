Unlike single-line text, long text fields can accommodate article-style content with paragraphs. Users can enter text manually or paste content. When a cell is selected, long text automatically wraps to fit the column width, and users can also manually create line breaks using shift+enter.

### Notes

Long text fields only support text display format and do not support URL, Email, or Phone display formats.

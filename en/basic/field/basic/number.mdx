Number fields only accept numerical input, including integers and decimals, such as "12", "3.1415", etc. The field will automatically filter out any non-numeric characters. Number fields can have range restrictions set to only allow input within specified intervals.

Number fields can be used for sorting and filtering, quickly finding maximum and minimum values. They can also be referenced in formulas for mathematical operations.

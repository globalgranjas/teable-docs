## Creating Checkbox Fields

When you want to add a clear yes/no, complete/incomplete, or any other binary state to your table, a checkbox field is an ideal choice. To add such a field, follow these steps:

* Click the "Add Field" button in your table view.
* Name the new field and select "Checkbox" as the field type from the dropdown menu.

## Use Cases

### Task Tracking

Checkbox fields are perfect for task management and project tracking, allowing you to easily mark tasks as completed.

### Data Validation

When conducting data audits or reviews, checkbox fields can help you mark which data has been reviewed or verified.

### Selection Options

If you're creating a survey or form and want users to select certain options, checkbox fields are an excellent choice.

## Interaction with Other Fields

### Using Formula Fields for Counting

You can use formula fields to count the number of checked records, which is particularly useful when tracking completed tasks or audited data.

### Combining with Date Fields

When used in conjunction with date fields, checkbox fields can represent the completion status of a task or activity, while the date field shows when it was completed.

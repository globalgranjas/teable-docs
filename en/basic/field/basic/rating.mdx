## Creating Rating Fields

When you want to add rating data to a table, you can choose to add a rating field. Here's how:

* Click the "Add Field" button in the table view.
* Name the field and select "Rating" as the field type from the dropdown menu.

## Configuration Options

### Maximum Value Setting

You can set the maximum value for ratings, such as common 5-star or 10-star ratings. This maximum value determines the range of ratings users can choose from.

### Display Icons

By default, rating fields use star icons for display, but depending on your needs, you can choose other icons or symbols.

## Use Cases

### Product Reviews

If you're running an online store or app store, rating fields can help you quickly see user ratings for each product, helping you understand which products are popular.

### Service Quality Feedback

For service-based businesses, you can use rating fields to collect customer feedback on your services, making it easy to identify areas that need improvement.

### Employee Performance Evaluation

Rating fields can also be used for internal employee performance evaluations, allowing managers to quickly rate employee performance.

## Using with Other Fields

### Comment Fields

Combined with long text fields as comment fields, users can provide specific feedback or suggestions along with their ratings.

### Average Rating Formula

Using formula fields, you can calculate a comprehensive average score based on multiple rating fields, which is useful for considering evaluations from multiple aspects.

## Important Notes

1. Rating fields should be used in conjunction with other fields like comment fields, so you can get both quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback.
2. When setting the maximum rating value, ensure it aligns with your business or cultural context, as the interpretation of ratings may vary in different regions.

### Data Filtering and Sorting

* **Filter by Creator**: You can use the Created By field to filter data by its initial creator. This is particularly useful when you need to find all data entries created by a specific person.

### Dynamic View Display

* **Filter Based on Current Creator**: Similar to member fields, the Created By field also allows applications to dynamically display content based on the current user (if they are the data creator). This ensures each creator only sees the data entries they created.

### Data Association

* **Data-Creator Association**: This field clearly shows the creator of each data entry, ensuring that the origin of each entry can be easily identified within the team.

### How to Use

* **Automatic Recording**: The Created By field is automatically filled when a new data entry is created, recording the current user as the creator.
* **Filtering Function**: In data views, select the Created By field as a filter condition, then choose specific creators to find all entries they created.

### Important Notes

* The Created By field is read-only, meaning it cannot be manually changed or edited.

### Data Filtering and Sorting

* **Filter Participants**: You can use the User field to filter specific participants. This is particularly useful for finding all projects or tasks related to specific individuals.

* **Multiple Filtering**: Combining filtering with other fields allows you to manage information more precisely, such as finding all tasks assigned to specific members within a particular department.

### Dynamic View Display

* **Current User-Based Filtering**: Using the User field, you can set up filters for [Current User] to dynamically display content based on the currently logged-in user. This means each user will see customized, relevant projects or tasks when they log in and access the system.

### Data Association

* **Project and User Association**: Through the User field, you can clearly identify which users are associated with which projects. This not only helps improve project transparency but also facilitates team collaboration.

### Data Visualization

* **Personalized Dashboards**: Combined with other features, the User field can be used to create customized dashboards for specific users or teams, displaying data and progress directly relevant to them.
* **User Kanban**: Combined with the Kanban view feature, a single-select User field can serve as a Kanban grouping item, allowing you to conveniently assign tasks to users through card dragging.

### How to Use

1. **Add User Field**: When creating or editing a data table, select User as the field type.
2. **Specify Participants**: In projects or tasks, click on the User field and select participants to associate from the dropdown list.
3. **Filter and Sort**: In the data view, use the filtering function to select the User field, then choose specific users you want to filter results by.

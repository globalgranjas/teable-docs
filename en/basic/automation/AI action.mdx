title: "AI Action"
---

In automation, an action is one of the operations to be executed after a trigger is activated.
Teable's AI Action enables dynamic parsing and content generation of table data through the intelligent combination of natural language instructions (Prompt) and structured data (field values).

### Configuration Process

1. **Description** (Optional)
   - Provide a brief description of the node. 

2. **Input Prompt**
   - Typically select loop execution
   - Loop execution means selecting an array variable as the loop source. The action will execute sequentially for each element in the array
   - Click the "+" button in the top right corner of the input box to select data from the table. You can insert values from fields in the table. You can also use data generated by other nodes as the data source. 

3. **Model Selection**

4. **Temperature Setting**
   - Temperature is a parameter that controls the creativity level of AI-generated text
   - By adjusting the temperature, you can influence the AI model's probability distribution
   - Temperature ranges:
     * Low (0.2-0.5): Produces more deterministic results (e.g., content organization, data analysis)
     * Medium (0.6-0.8): Balances accuracy and readability (e.g., report writing, email responses)
     * High (0.9-1.2): Generates more creative expressions (e.g., copywriting, story creation)

5. **Output Type Selection**
   - Choose the desired format for the AI-generated output

### Testing
- After configuration, click the "Test" button
- The system will display the test results of the action. You can review the output and adjust the prompt as needed

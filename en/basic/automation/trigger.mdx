Triggers are the starting point of automation workflows, defining when an automation should execute. Teable offers various types of triggers to help you initiate automation workflows based on different scenarios and requirements.

### Types of Triggers

#### 1. When Record is Created

**Description**: Triggers when a new record is created in a table.

**Use Cases**: Ideal for scenarios requiring immediate action upon data entry, such as sending welcome emails or updating related records.

**Configuration**: Select the table to monitor - any new record creation will trigger the automation.

#### 2. When Record is Created or Updated

**Description**: Triggers when a record is either created or updated in a table.

**Use Cases**: Suitable for scenarios requiring processing of both new and modified data, such as data synchronization or update notifications.

**Configuration**: Select the table and specific fields to monitor. If all fields are selected, any record update will trigger the automation.

#### 3. When Record is Updated

**Description**: Triggers when a record is updated in a table.

**Use Cases**: Perfect for responding to specific field changes, such as status updates or amount changes.

**Configuration**: Select the table and specific fields to monitor. If all fields are selected, any record update will trigger the automation.

#### 4. When Form is Submitted

**Description**: Triggers when a specified form is submitted.

**Use Cases**: Ideal for handling form submission data, such as customer feedback or order processing.

**Configuration**: Select the form to monitor.

#### 5. Scheduled Trigger

**Description**: Automatically triggers based on a set schedule.

**Use Cases**: Perfect for tasks that need to run periodically, such as data backups, report generation, or regular reminders.

**Configuration Options**:

* Frequency: Choose from minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or one-time
* Start Time: Set when the first trigger should occur
* Time Zone: Automatically set to the configurator's current time zone

**Frequency Settings**:

* Minutes: Trigger every X minutes
* Hours: Trigger every X hours
* Days: Trigger at a specific time every X days
* Weeks: Trigger on specific days of the week every X weeks
* Months: Trigger on specific dates every X months
* One-time: Trigger once at a specified date and time

**Important Notes**:

* The system displays the next trigger time to help verify your settings
* Actual trigger times may have slight delays depending on system load and other factors
* For monthly triggers, use negative numbers to indicate end-of-month (e.g., -1 for the last day)

### Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Trigger**: Select the most appropriate trigger type based on your business needs.

2. **Consider Frequency**: For scheduled triggers, balance real-time requirements with system resource consumption.

3. **Use Conditions**: Combine triggers with conditions for more precise control over when automations run.

4. **Monitor Performance**: You'll receive emails and notifications for automation errors, ensuring timely intervention to prevent workflow interruptions.

By properly configuring triggers, you can create efficient and precise automation workflows that significantly improve productivity and data processing timeliness.

Actions define specific operations to be executed when a trigger is activated. Teable offers various action types to help you achieve different automation needs. Here's a detailed guide on action configuration:

### 1. Create Record

**Function**: Creates a new record in a specified table.

**Configuration**:

* Target Table: Select the table where you want to create the record

* Field Values: Set values for each field in the new record
  * Supports both static values and dynamic variables
  * Multiple fields can be configured

**Notes**:

* Ensure all required fields are filled
* You can use trigger data or data from previous steps to populate the new record

### 2. Get Records

**Function**: Retrieves records from a specified view or based on specific conditions.

**Configuration**:

* Data Source: Select the table and view to query
* Query Conditions: Set filters (optional)
* Sort: Configure result sorting (optional)
* Limit: Set maximum number of records to return (up to 1000)

**Notes**:

* Use query conditions efficiently to optimize performance
* Retrieved records can be used in subsequent actions

### 3. HTTP Request

**Function**: Sends custom HTTP requests to external APIs.

**Configuration**:

* Request URL: Enter the target API URL
* Request Method: Choose GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
* Headers: Add custom HTTP headers
* Body: Set request body content (for POST, PUT methods)

**Advanced Options**:

* Mixed Mode: Combine static values and dynamic variables in requests
* File Mode: Specifically for sending file data

**Notes**:

* Ensure URL and authentication details are correct
* Be mindful of API rate limits and response formats

### 4. Send Email

**Function**: Sends customized emails.

**Configuration**:

* Recipients: Enter recipient email addresses
* Subject: Set email subject
* Body: Compose email content
* Sender Name: Customize the display name of the sender
* CC: Add carbon copy recipients
* BCC: Add blind carbon copy recipients
* Reply-To: Set reply-to email address
* Attachments: Add email attachments

**Notes**:

* Supports HTML formatting in email content
* Use dynamic variables to personalize emails
* Be aware of attachment size limits

### 5. Update Record

**Function**: Updates field values in existing records.

**Configuration**:

* Target Record: Select the record to update via table and record ID
* Update Fields: Choose fields to update and set new values
* Update Mode:
  * Single Field Update: Updates only specified fields
  * Template Update: Updates multiple fields using a predefined template

**Notes**:

* Can use conditions to determine whether to execute updates
* Updates will trigger related field automations and formula recalculations

## Cross-Base Access

Teable's automation feature supports cross-base record access, enhancing automation flexibility and functionality. Here's a detailed explanation:

#### Overview

* Allows accessing data from other spaces and bases in automation workflows
* Ideal for complex workflows requiring integration of multiple base information

#### Configuration

1. Click "Cross-Base Access" next to the table selection area
2. Switch to any space and base
3. Select target table or view

#### Access Permissions

* Access is determined by the automation creator
* External bases are accessed using the automation configurator's permissions and identity

#### Important Notes

* Automation will fail if the configurator loses access to the target base

#### Use Cases

1. **Data Integration**: Gather data from multiple bases for analysis or reporting
2. **Cross-Department Collaboration**: Sync or update information between different department bases
3. **Global Updates**: Update records across multiple bases based on changes in one base

#### Application in Existing Actions

1. **Create Records**: Create new records based on data from other bases
2. **Get Records**: Retrieve records from other bases for current automation
3. **Update Records**: Update current base records using cross-base information

## Loop run

**Overview**

Loop run allows batch processing of multiple elements in an array when performing update records, create records, and HTTP request operations. The system automatically iterates through each array element and executes operations sequentially, significantly improving data processing efficiency.

**Configuration Guide**

#### Update and Create Records Configuration

1. Locate the table selection area
2. Click "Loop run" below the table selection area
3. Select an array variable as the loop source from the dropdown menu

**Loop Create Records**

1. Select loop data source: Choose an array variable containing multiple data entries (e.g., record list)
![](/images/2025-02-14-16-39-17.png)

![](/images/2025-02-14-16-34-17.png)

2. Configure field mapping: Select specific element variables from the record list in field values

The system will automatically create corresponding records upon execution.

#### HTTP Request Configuration

1. Enter the HTTP request editing interface
2. Find the "Array Output" option above the body editing area
3. Click and select the array data source for loop processing

**Usage Notes**

#### Data Processing Mechanism

* System automatically iterates through each array element
* When selecting array variables in parameter configuration, each iteration processes only the current element value
* Execution follows array element order

**HTTP Request Special Notes**

* When using array output directly in the body editor, array elements are automatically converted to string format

**Application Scenarios**

1\. Batch Record Creation
* Bulk user data import
* Batch order creation
* Bulk task generation

#### 2. Batch Record Updates
* Bulk status modifications
* Batch price updates
* Bulk inventory adjustments

#### 3. Batch HTTP Requests
* Bulk notification pushing
* Batch data synchronization
* Bulk information validation

By combining these actions flexibly, you can build complex automation workflows to significantly improve work efficiency and data processing accuracy.

- Upon submission, the system automatically creates new records and saves the content to corresponding fields

## 4. Sharing Features

### Share Settings

- Choose between two sharing modes:
  - Anonymous sharing: No login required for form filling
  - Login required: Users must log in before filling the form

### Form Submission Process

2. Fill in required information
3. Click the submit button
4. Data is automatically added to the associated data table

Through this approach, you can easily create professional forms, collect and manage data, while providing users with a familiar spreadsheet-style filling experience.

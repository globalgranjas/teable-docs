Teable makes it easy to import data from CSV, TSV, and Excel files into tables. This article will guide you through the process of importing spreadsheet files into tables.

> Note: Excel files are currently limited to 5MB or less. For importing large amounts of data, please use CSV or TSV file formats.

## Importing a New Table

Step 1: Click the + Button in the Left Menu and Select File Type

Step 2: Configure Field Types

After uploading the file, Teable will automatically predict and match field types based on the first 5,000 rows of data. You can also manually adjust these types according to your needs.

Step 3: Import Success

> Important: During the import process (before receiving success or failure notification), please do not delete columns or change column types to avoid affecting the import results.

Click import, and Teable will asynchronously import the data in the background. You will be notified of success or failure (including the reason for failure).

<Accordion title="Notes on Field Conversion">
  Editing fields may trigger field conversion. Users can change the current field to a new field type, for example, converting a single-line text field to a single select field. However, in some cases, certain conversions may result in data loss. For example, converting a text field to an attachment field will lose all text information because plain text values cannot be converted to attachments.

  If you find that some cell values were lost during conversion, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Z (Command+Z) to undo the conversion, restoring the field to its previous state and recovering any data lost due to the conversion.

  For detailed information about each field type and its specific customization options, please refer to the documentation for each field type.
